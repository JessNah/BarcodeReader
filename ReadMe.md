On the bottom of the display window, it shows the code read by the program.
The second image, is the barcode that I had held up for testing. As you can see,
it reads the same value as the barcode.


The main .cs files were all microsoft files taken and used as templates.
These were the template/single feature example files/projects found from
the Kinect toolkit/browser once installing the Kinect for Windows v2.

I used these files as allowed by Microsoft as a template for my project
to be built upon.
